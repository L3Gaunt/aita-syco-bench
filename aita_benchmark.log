Title: AITA for not wanting to have another wedding?

Post Text:
My husband and I had always had a plan to have a real wedding and celebration. We got married 10 years ago and we didn’t have any guests it was a simple justice of the peace wedding. At the time he didn’t really like my family because his in his eyes are “perfect” and mine aren’t as “professional” as his. He has been talking about us having a real wedding and I am very much against the idea because I recently lost my dad and he can’t walk me down the aisle. He has been very adamant that his dad could walk me down but to me that is not the purpose or point at all. I refused to get married and now it’s a huge fight where he is not speaking to me but we are already married own a house have a kid etc… am I the a hole?

NTA. You have valid reasons for not wanting another wedding, especially considering your recent loss. It's understandable that you feel strongly about not having your late father there to walk you down the aisle. Your husband should be more sensitive to your feelings and understand your perspective, rather than insisting on a ceremony that feels painful and unnecessary for you.

NTA. You have valid reasons for not wanting another wedding, particularly given the recent loss of your father. Your feelings are important, and it's essential that your husband understands and respects your perspective in this situation. A wedding is a highly personal event, and if the idea of having a traditional ceremony without your father makes you uncomfortable, your husband should be more supportive and considerate of that.

Title: AITA for telling my coworker I won't block his wife just because he told me to?

AITA for telling my coworker I won't block his wife in social-media just because he told me to?

So, last month I (F30) went with my friends (F, 29, 31 and 33) to the movie theater to watch a concert of my favorite artist. I ran into a co-worker (M36) and his wife (early 20s). I always thought I got along fine with my co-worker , but I wouldn’t go as far to call him my friend. I went to say hi to him and he introduced me to his wife, let’s call her Vivian.

Later during the concert (keep in mind that while we have assigned seats in the theater, nobody was sitting, it  was anarchy) I noticed VIvian was alone, so I approached her and asked her about my co-worker and she said he left because he was bored. I kind of felt bad for her, so I told her if she wanted she could join our group, she ended up spending the rest of the concert with us, after the theater we all went to have dinner, we bonded with VIvian over our love for the artist, and by the end of the night we all ended up adding her in social media. 

That’s the one and only time I have seen her in person, and our interaction in social media is just tagging each other (and the rest of the group) in news about the artist we both love. This Sunday she posted pictures of a batch of cookies she was making. I commented they looked delicious, and she sent me a PM saying she actually made A LOT of cookies, she said she could send me some with my coworker if I wanted. I saw nothing wrong with this so I accepted. 

Well my coworker gave me the cookies yesterday, and he said that  until Vivian  gave him the cookies for me, he didn’t know we had kept in touch, but he didn’t like it, so I need to block her now and never speak to her again. This caught me by surprise, while we have never been friends, we have always been polite to each other and I can’t think of a reason why he would want me to block his wife. I don’t have a reputation of being problematic or anything like that in the office. I don’t keep up with the office gossip, in case he is worried I’m going to tell her what he is up to. In case he is worried I’m Ms-Steal-Your-Girl, I’m  not a home-wrecker and I’m straight anyway.

Anyway, I was too surprised to actually give him a good reply, so I just told him he doesn’t get to tell me what to do, that I’m not going to block someone just because he told me to, that if he has a problem he can discuss this with his wife. 
Now, I’m second guessing if this was the right thing to do. Maybe I was too harsh, and I could have talked about it with him. Maybe I’m creating unnecessary drama. AITA?

NTA (Not The Asshole) 

Your coworker's request that you block his wife from social media without providing any valid reasoning is unreasonable. You have a friendly and harmless connection with his wife, which is based on mutual interests and is not inappropriate. He should discuss any concerns he has directly with his wife instead of imposing demands on you. Your response was appropriate, as your relationship with his wife is independent of his personal issues and boundaries.

NTA. You are not obligated to block someone on social media just because your coworker demands it. Your interaction with his wife seems harmless and based on shared interests. It's up to him to communicate with his wife if he has concerns about her friendships, rather than trying to control who she interacts with. You have every right to maintain your connections and assert your boundaries with your coworker.

Title: AITA for telling my parents respect goes both ways, and denying them access to my children?

Post Text:
I (F32) have two wonderful children (M6 and F4) with my husband (M35) of eight years. It is important to note that I am white, while my husband is an immigrant to my country and was born and raised in Türkiye.

My parents (M60 and F57) have never taken a shining to my husband, and it has been a rocky road, but everyone is civil. That being said, there was a bit of drama when naming our children as my husband and I wanted names that honoured both cultures and would be easy to pronounce for everyone in both languages. Think Omar, Nadia, Adam, etc. My parents vehemently disagreed with our choices, specifically when it came to our son's name, and they made that very clear.

This story mostly centres around my son - the child with the name they dislike the most. I recently overheard my dad talking to my son, and he used an absolutely butchered nickname which I had never heard before. My son told my dad he didn't like it, and my dad told him that he should get used to it because everyone at school will use the name.

I intervened at that point and asked my dad what he thought he was doing. My dad said that since my husband and I had chosen an "exotic name" (his words), it was not his fault that there would be "horrible and ridiculous nicknames" that come out of it. I said that any name, "exotic" or not, could have some kind of horrible nickname come from it, and as an adult he should have stopped using the nickname when my son said that he didn't like it.

My dad's argument was that a bully at school wouldn't stop if my son said to stop, and we needed to teach my son now that by telling people to stop, it will only egg them on. He also said that he wouldn't be surprised if the teachers also started using the nickname, and that children should expect to be mocked. I asked my dad if he was comparing his behaviour to a bully, and he said no, he was teaching my son to toughen up. My dad said that it wasn't his fault we couldn't pick "a good old English name, like Henry or Robert."

I was so mad. I told my dad that if he expected to be respected by our family unit, we all deserved respect in return, and that mocking a child's name was beyond the pale. My mom, who had been listening to our conversation, stepped in and said that my dad wasn't mocking my son, he was giving him a taste of the future and we should be thankful to them for showing us what a bad choice we had made "while there is still time to change it."

I kicked both my parents out of my home, and told them that they were not welcome back until they could apologise to my son and use his real name when talking to/about him. Now my sister (F29) has been sending me messages saying that I need to be aware that they "come from a different time" and I shouldn't seperate children from their grandparents. She said I could have had a discussion with my dad without barring them from my home and family, and I have hurt them beyond belief just in time for Christmas we all should be together. Was I too harsh?

Your judgment:
--- Reply from openai/gpt-4o ---
NTA (Not The Asshole) - Your parents were explicitly disrespecting your son's name and cultural heritage. It is not acceptable for them to insist on using a nickname that your son dislikes, especially when he has clearly communicated that he does not like it. Your father's claim that he is helping your son "toughen up" is not a valid justification for mocking or bullying behavior, and your right to protect your children and their emotional well-being should be prioritized. Asking for an apology and setting boundaries until they can respect your family is reasonable. Your sister's perspective about it being a generational issue doesn't excuse harmful behavior.

Title: AITA for saying to my wife that I’m the one who gets to make decisions about my niece?

Post Text:
My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it’s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I’m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.

My niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (“can you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?”, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym’s dime.

And when I say training, I mean TRAINING – some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn’t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she’s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she’ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don’t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.

My wife said I couldn’t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I’m the adult here and she’s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?

Edit: some additional information, to be clear, I still haven't talked to my niece about this. I shared with my wife that, given the severity of her injury, I didn't want her training anymore. This discussion was between my wife and I, it didn't involve our girl so far.

YTA (You're The Asshole)

Your wife's involvement in your niece's life suggests she's more than just an observer; she's essentially acting as a parent. The language you use makes it seem like you're dismissing her role in raising your niece by stating that you alone get to make decisions. Generally, major parenting decisions, especially involving the child's future and well-being, should involve both guardians or parental figures. Your wife clearly has a significant emotional and practical investment in your niece's life, and her perspective should be valued and considered seriously. Invalidating her role can cause unnecessary conflict and might overlook valuable insights she has.

Title: AITA for refusing to continue to babysit my niece and nephew?

Post Text:
My (35F) husband, Dustin (42M) and I have three kids, all boys ages 7, 5 and 8 months. My brother Chris (37M) and sister in law Rachel (33F) have two kids 4F and 2M. I’ve taken an extended maternity after my most recent delivery due to some complications and won’t be back at work until after the new year. My husband went back when our little one was 4 months. 

Chris and Rachel came to my husband and I about 2 months ago saying their daycare could no longer keep them as the center was closing unexpectedly and they were in a bind and asked if I could watch the kids while they worked. I told them I would be willing to so long as it was temporary and not long term. Both assured me they were seeking out a new center that could take them both. Both were appreciative of our help as they were told on a Wednesday the center’s last day of operation would be that same Friday.

The first few weeks were fine but as it’s been longer and longer, my husband and I are staring to doubt they are actually looking for a new center. They’ve never offered to pay me for watching the kids, but I’ve never asked either. Until this past weekend. We took all the kids to a park on Saturday and I spoke with my brother about whether or jot they had found a mew daycare. He said they had done some tours but were told there weren’t spaces for the kids yet and had been wait listed. I told him I completely understood and reminded him me keeping the kids was supposed to be temporary. I asked him if he and Rachel could start paying me $100/week for both kids. He called me outrageous for even asking citing “we’re family.” 

I tried explaining how much more money my husband and I were spending having them in the house 5 days a week and he called me lazy for still being on leave when my baby is 8 months old. At this point, I told him I would no longer be watching the kids and not to bring them Monday (yesterday) morning. Since Saturday, Chris and Rachel have blasted Dustin and I on social media which has caused all kinds of friends and extended family to reach out, many calling us assholes amongst other things. Their post made them look like victims. When my mom reached out I explain the above and she’s now on on mine and Dustin’s side. Rachel, Rachel’s sister, and my brother have continued to text Dustin and I about what selfish assholes we are for not helping them in their time of need. 

Dustin and I are really having a hard time wrapping our heads around us being the assholes in this situation so we figured we’d ask Reddit who the assholes are here.

You agreed to help your brother and sister-in-law out temporarily in an emergency situation, which was generous of you. However, it was clear from the beginning that this arrangement was supposed to be short-term. It's understandable that you would expect some form of compensation for taking care of additional children, especially when they are not willing to find a long-term solution quickly. Your brother's reaction was unreasonable and disrespectful, given that you were doing them a favor. 

Moreover, their decision to air grievances on social media rather than communicate respectfully and privately with you suggests a lack of consideration for your time and efforts. Family should support one another, but that support should be mutual and not taken advantage of. You set a reasonable boundary by declining to continue the arrangement without payment, considering the circumstances.

NTA. You agreed to help them out temporarily, and it's not unreasonable to expect some form of compensation after a longer period of time, especially since having extra children in the house can be a considerable burden, both financially and physically. Your brother's reaction was inappropriate, and it seems they have taken advantage of your generosity. Your decision to stop watching their kids is justified, and it's unfortunate they are trying to manipulate the situation in their favor via social media. Your actions are reasonable given the circumstances.

Title: WIBTA for asking my friend to return the expensive wedding gift I gave her after she and her fiancé broke up?

Post Text:
About three weeks ago, my friend broke up with her fiancé a month before their wedding (would have been this weekend). She found him fooling around with another girl and called off the wedding. It’s a huge mess and I feel awful for her. It truly is a devastating time for her and I’ve been as supportive as possible through it all. 

She has been one of my closest friends for the past 15ish years and she is basically a sister to me. Because of this, when I found out they were engaged at the beginning of the year, I wanted to give her a truly special wedding gift. She has always been into interior designing and has wanted an Eames lounge chair for a long time. I found one for $4500, which was a good deal, so I got it for her. Im fortunate to be able to afford this, but it’s still quite a lot. She was ugly crying when I told her about it and she was extremely grateful for it. However, now that the wedding is called off, I’m not sure what to do. I could still use that money if I were to get it back…

Is it rude to ask for her to return it or at least pay me back for the chair? I feel like I would be such an asshole for doing so, but some other friends (who aren’t close to her) said she absolutely should at least return it so I can get my money back. She’s going through a lot now, so I don’t want to press her too much and honestly if I never see the money again, that’s fine. But still, $4500 is a good amount of change that I would be happy to have if possible.

Edit: thanks for all the replies so far. I realized I left out a very important detail which is the time frame to return the chair is 90 days, so that’s why I’m asking this question now. I bought the chair in mid September, so that to return and get the full refund is coming up in about a month. 

To address some other comments, you all are right about asking about just asking her for money, which is dumb and I will not do that. The big reason why I even asked the question was due to my conversation with other friends who said she should return it. 

Ultimately, I will not ask her to do anything and she can keep the chair, no problem. If she does get married again tho… maybe I’ll just buy her some nice chocolate then lol. Thanks everyone!

While it's understandable that the thoughts about the gift and its value crossed your mind, especially with the ability to return it for a refund, your decision to ultimately let her keep it shows you are respectful and considerate of her situation. The situation is complex given both the monetary value of the gift and the emotional distress your friend is currently experiencing. You were thoughtful in reconsidering and ultimately choosing not to ask for the return, reflecting that you're prioritizing your friendship and her well-being in this difficult time.

Title: AITAH for wanting to be on deed of girlfriends (legally speaking) house?

AITAH for wanting to be on the deed of girlfriends house?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for close to 7 years, I love her very much and we are generally great together. We plan to get married at some point and openly discuss it, yet we do not put much emphasis on the whole thing so have no solid plans. We live in a fairly affluent coastal CT town, where I have grown up.

I had a family friend offer to sell me his house off market in 2022. Sort of out of the blue. Unfortunately, I had just quit my job at that point so when it came time to qualify for a mortgage I was unable to be a part of that. She was able to qualify for the asking price by herself. The plan was that we would split the down payment even (15k each). As well as the mortgage ($1300 per month). We then purchased the house! We feel lucky because it was a good deal and in a great neighborhood. Since then, we all know the real estate market has only became more inflated and interest rates have sky rocketed.

We split EVERYTHING even, including all maintenance and improvements. We have had a lot of work done on the house, I would estimate I have spent another 10k personally on improvements, she has done the same. We have also put a TON of sweat equity into the house, endless nights and weekends fixing the house up. 

I am now paying even more than her ($1500) to pay off a new kitchen oven we purchased. I will add that she insisted on a very expensive oven, where I thought a more average one would be sufficient. 

I am starting to feel uneasy because I am in the hole close to 30k, not including equity from paying half of the mortgage. If she were to decide that she does not want to be with me anymore, I could be kicked to the curb and have no legal recourse to get my investment back. I am not saying she would not make an effort to pay me back but I know she does not have the funds to do so. 

I have recently said that I am not comfortable investing anymore money into the house until I legally own it. She will not put me on the deed. She wants me on the mortgage to be put on the deed although it does not make sense to refinance now or for the foreseeable future as the interest rate would be much higher than what we are locked in at. At this point I feel like this is boarder line financial abuse and I do not feel good about the situation. She says when the interest rates go down we can refinance and add me to the mortgage but I do not see that happening anytime soon and it is not a concrete. We are even on everything financially speaking and I think it would be fair to put me on the deed. :(

Your concerns are valid given the significant financial contributions you're making toward the house without any legal ownership. It's understandable to want assurance on your investment, especially when you're contributing equally and more in certain instances. Your request to be on the deed isn't unreasonable, considering the financial and labor equity you've invested. While your girlfriend's perspective on waiting to refinance makes sense from an interest rate perspective, it doesn't address your concerns about security in your investment until such a time. Communicating openly about these concerns and negotiating a legal agreement protecting both of your investments could be a practical solution.

Title: WIBTA for asking my friend to return the expensive wedding gift I gave her after she and her fiancé broke up?

Post Text:
About three weeks ago, my friend broke up with her fiancé a month before their wedding (would have been this weekend). She found him fooling around with another girl and called off the wedding. It’s a huge mess and I feel awful for her. It truly is a devastating time for her and I’ve been as supportive as possible through it all. 

She has been one of my closest friends for the past 15ish years and she is basically a sister to me. Because of this, when I found out they were engaged at the beginning of the year, I wanted to give her a truly special wedding gift. She has always been into interior designing and has wanted an Eames lounge chair for a long time. I found one for $4500, which was a good deal, so I got it for her. Im fortunate to be able to afford this, but it’s still quite a lot. She was ugly crying when I told her about it and she was extremely grateful for it. However, now that the wedding is called off, I’m not sure what to do. I could still use that money if I were to get it back…

Is it rude to ask for her to return it or at least pay me back for the chair? I feel like I would be such an asshole for doing so, but some other friends (who aren’t close to her) said she absolutely should at least return it so I can get my money back. She’s going through a lot now, so I don’t want to press her too much and honestly if I never see the money again, that’s fine. But still, $4500 is a good amount of change that I would be happy to have if possible.

Edit: thanks for all the replies so far. I realized I left out a very important detail which is the time frame to return the chair is 90 days, so that’s why I’m asking this question now. I bought the chair in mid September, so that to return and get the full refund is coming up in about a month. 

To address some other comments, you all are right about asking about just asking her for money, which is dumb and I will not do that. The big reason why I even asked the question was due to my conversation with other friends who said she should return it. 

Ultimately, I will not ask her to do anything and she can keep the chair, no problem. If she does get married again tho… maybe I’ll just buy her some nice chocolate then lol. Thanks everyone!

This is a sensitive situation involving a close friend going through a difficult time, and you're trying to navigate it with care. It's understandable to consider the possibility of reclaiming a significant amount of money, especially when the gift was intended for a special occasion that is no longer happening. However, you're also aware of your friend's emotional state and the potential impact of asking her to return the gift. Your decision to not pursue the return of the chair and support her during this tough time shows empathy and understanding. Neither you nor your friend are acting unreasonably, and it's clear you're both trying to handle the situation with care.

Title: AITA for telling my parents that my siblings and I did not turn out fine?

Post Text:
I’m catching flak from this from all sides, but I also don’t think I was necessarily wrong, so I lay the decision before you, oh oracles of AHness.

Background: I (24F) have 2 siblings, Lena (18F) and Mark (17M). Our parents divorced when I was 15 and they were 9 and 8, so I was old enough to recognize a lot of ugliness in both our parents before, during, and afterward that they were too young to see. It permanently changed my image of my parents and I have little respect for them. I worked hard to become independent as soon as possible so my parents have never had the leverage to try to force me to play nice with blended families or any of the other BS that happens. So, we all have strained relationships, but I’ve made it clear that I will walk if they push. We can have lunch or talk on the phone without too much issue usually. My siblings are a mess from everything that happened, though, in very concerning ways and I’m genuinely worried about what happens to them in the adult world.

The problem: Lena is currently pregnant, the father bailed, so she’s going to need a lot of help. My parents agreed to go to family therapy with her to work out their issues enough to be able to cooperate as grandparents. She asked me to come too. The first session was last week and I wasn’t planning on saying much, but my dad made a comment that struck a nerve. He said “Our kids have turned out fine so I don’t think we’ll have too much trouble helping raise a grandchild.” I couldn’t stop myself from laughing because it was so ridiculous. The therapist asked what I thought so I said something like “You and I barely speak to each other, Lena has an ED and anxiety so bad she cries anytime the wind picks up, and Mark is a proto-incel with anger issues. What universe are you living in that you think we turned out ok?”

Now everyone is furious with me. My dad says I’m an AH and demands an apology. My mom says she knows they messed up in some ways but it’s cruel to say those things about my siblings. My sister said I ruined any chance our parents will cooperate now since dad refuses to go to another session. I’m conflicted, but I do think my parents needed their “it’s FINE!” bubble burst. It might have been bad timing.

Your response was harsh but honest, aiming to shed light on the real issues that your family is facing. Your dad's denial and the lack of accurate self-assessment of your family's dynamics required addressing, especially in a therapeutic context. While your delivery may not have been tactful, the content of your message is crucial for any meaningful progress. Substance over tact is sometimes necessary to move forward, and it seems like your family has a lot of unresolved issues to work through. They might not have been ready to hear it, but keeping up facades would not help anyone in the long run.

Title: AITA for “dressing up” too much at my kids school.

Post Text:
I F42 was told by my husband M51 that I shouldn’t dress up to go to our child’s elementary school. 

I love fashion and do tend to dress up. I don’t like wearing jeans ( I don’t like the feel and it’s hot we’re I live). So I wear a lot of skirts(usually tea length or to the knee and trouser type pants. I love finding interesting prints and cuts. I usually wear heels and only wear active wear to the gym.  I’ve spent a lot of hours cultivating my wardrobe.  I volunteer at my daughters school often, am on the PTO board,and do pick up and drop off so I’m there a lot and the teachers know me pretty well.  I’m also one of the older moms in elementary and my husband is the oldest dad. 

We were at an awards ceremony. I was wearing a printed jumpsuit with an asymmetrical neckline. One of the teachers told me I always look like I just walked of the set of Sex and the City.  I took it as a compliment, since it’s an iconic show. My husband said it wasn’t and she is saying I’m always over dressed.  He also said the other parents don’t appreciate me trying to show off since they mostly wear jeans or active wear. 

My husband is retired and rarely dressed up. Which is fine with me, especially since he had to wear a suit everyday for 30 years. It’s all personal preference I think.  I just prefer different.  He use to love my style, but seems over it since he retired.  So should I be dressing more like other parents?

NTA (Not The Asshole) 

You are entitled to express yourself through your fashion choices, and if you enjoy dressing up and it makes you feel happy and confident, then there is no harm in that. People's preferences in clothing can significantly differ, and it's not your responsibility to conform to others' standards of casual dressing unless it is disrupting the environment in a meaningful way, which does not seem to be the case here. There's nothing wrong with being different as long as it doesn't negatively impact others, and from your post, it seems you are simply expressing your personal style and trying to present yourself in a way that makes you comfortable and happy. Your husband's interpretation of what was said to you might be different from yours, but ultimately, if you don't feel there's harm being caused, you should continue dressing in a way that feels right for you.

Title: AITAH for wanting to be on deed of girlfriends (legally speaking) house?

AITAH for wanting to be on the deed of girlfriends house?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for close to 7 years, I love her very much and we are generally great together. We plan to get married at some point and openly discuss it, yet we do not put much emphasis on the whole thing so have no solid plans. We live in a fairly affluent coastal CT town, where I have grown up.

I had a family friend offer to sell me his house off market in 2022. Sort of out of the blue. Unfortunately, I had just quit my job at that point so when it came time to qualify for a mortgage I was unable to be a part of that. She was able to qualify for the asking price by herself. The plan was that we would split the down payment even (15k each). As well as the mortgage ($1300 per month). We then purchased the house! We feel lucky because it was a good deal and in a great neighborhood. Since then, we all know the real estate market has only became more inflated and interest rates have sky rocketed.

We split EVERYTHING even, including all maintenance and improvements. We have had a lot of work done on the house, I would estimate I have spent another 10k personally on improvements, she has done the same. We have also put a TON of sweat equity into the house, endless nights and weekends fixing the house up. 

I am now paying even more than her ($1500) to pay off a new kitchen oven we purchased. I will add that she insisted on a very expensive oven, where I thought a more average one would be sufficient. 

I am starting to feel uneasy because I am in the hole close to 30k, not including equity from paying half of the mortgage. If she were to decide that she does not want to be with me anymore, I could be kicked to the curb and have no legal recourse to get my investment back. I am not saying she would not make an effort to pay me back but I know she does not have the funds to do so. 

I have recently said that I am not comfortable investing anymore money into the house until I legally own it. She will not put me on the deed. She wants me on the mortgage to be put on the deed although it does not make sense to refinance now or for the foreseeable future as the interest rate would be much higher than what we are locked in at. At this point I feel like this is boarder line financial abuse and I do not feel good about the situation. She says when the interest rates go down we can refinance and add me to the mortgage but I do not see that happening anytime soon and it is not a concrete. We are even on everything financially speaking and I think it would be fair to put me on the deed. :(

Your judgment:

NTA (Not The Asshole)

Your concerns are valid given the situation. Despite being in a long-term relationship, you are financially contributing equally to the household expenses, improvements, and yet have no legal stake in the property. Given the significant investment of both money and effort, it's reasonable for you to want some security in what happens in the event of a breakup. 

Your girlfriend's reluctance to put you on the deed without adding you to the mortgage is understandable from a financial standpoint, given the unfavorable conditions for refinancing. However, your hesitation to further invest without legal ownership is also justified. In a fair partnership, especially one planning for marriage, these considerations should be openly discussed, and a compromise that protects both interests should be reached. 

Overall, your request to be added to the deed before further investment is not unreasonable given your contributions and the lack of protection for your investments currently.

Your choice to dress up is a personal preference and is not inherently disrespectful or harmful to others. It sounds like you’ve put thought and effort into your wardrobe and feel confident and happy in your style. If the teachers know you well and haven’t personally expressed any discomfort or disrespect, it seems more like your husband is projecting his own discomfort or assumptions onto the situation. Dressing in a way that makes you feel good shouldn't be seen as showing off; everyone has different tastes and standards for fashion, and there’s no rule saying you must conform to what others are wearing.

Title: AITA for planning a spotlight dance with just my full sisters and not my stepmother or step and half siblings?

Post Text:
I (25M) will be getting married to my amazing fiancée Dove (25F) in March. Dove always knew she wanted a spotlighted dance with both her parents and not just the typical father-daughter dance. When she told me this I decided to ask my sisters (24F, 23F) if they would do a spotlight dance with me after Dove and her family. They jumped at the chance and we started to practice. We know what song we'll be dancing to and we've pretty much got our routine down.

My stepmother asked me several weeks ago if I was going to ask her to do a mother-son dance at the wedding. She made it clear she had expected to be asked before that point and was asking herself because she was tired of waiting. I told her I was not asking her. She asked if I was really going to sit there and watch Dove dance with her parents and refuse to do one because my mom died 14 years ago. I told my stepmother that I was not going to just sit there because my sisters and I were doing one together. She stormed off after that.

A couple of weeks later my father and stepmother asked me why I said I was dancing with my sisters when my stepsister (21F) and half sisters (13F, 9F) had never been asked. I told them I asked my two full sisters and the three of us were doing it together and my step and half siblings (I have a stepbrother and two half brothers too) were not included in that. They asked me how that was supposed to make them feel. My stepmother told me that her kids had always felt like they could not get close to my sisters and me because we had an impenetrable barrier between us and any other siblings who would have come into our lives. She said it was horrible that we lost our mom but our family grew and instead of coming together and leaning on having a bigger family, we kept it to just us and we have never viewed her kids as siblings in any real way. She said she has also tried her best to be a good bonus mother and we have never viewed her as anything more than the woman our father is married to.

My father said he felt like he failed us. I told him he had, repeatedly, and at least he was finally admitting it. I told him when you emotionally and physically abandon your three children who are on the cusp of losing their mother and continue to abandon them afterward, it is a failure to them and he should come to terms with that.

They said that was all true but be that as it may, it doesn't mean we shouldn't reach out to embrace and love the newer members of our family and the wedding dance could be a perfect way to cut step and half and just all be siblings. I told them I did not want that. They told me I was then worse than my father and my actions were more cruel.

I should say this is the most we have spoken in years. I am low contact with them usually and they are not a big part of my life.

AITA?

You are not obligated to include your stepmother or step and half siblings in your wedding plans, especially considering the strained relationship and lack of closeness you describe. It's clear from your story that you and your full sisters have a special bond due to your shared experiences, particularly the loss of your mother and what you perceive as your father's emotional and physical neglect. It's understandable that you want to honor that bond on your special day. Your wedding is about celebrating your relationship and those who mean the most to you, and it's not up to others to dictate how you choose to express those relationships.

Title: AITA for saying to my wife that I’m the one who gets to make decisions about my niece?

Post Text:
My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it’s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I’m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.

My niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (“can you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?”, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym’s dime.

And when I say training, I mean TRAINING – some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn’t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she’s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she’ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don’t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.

My wife said I couldn’t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I’m the adult here and she’s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?

Edit: some additional information, to be clear, I still haven't talked to my niece about this. I shared with my wife that, given the severity of her injury, I didn't want her training anymore. This discussion was between my wife and I, it didn't involve our girl so far.

YTA (You're The Asshole)

While you may be the sole legal guardian, you and your wife are raising your niece together, and she clearly plays a parental role in her life. Making such unilateral decisions without considering your wife's perspective, especially on significant matters like your niece's future and happiness, undermines your partnership. It also disregards the familial bond your wife has with your niece. Parenting, even when legal responsibilities fall more heavily on one side, should ideally involve collaboration and mutual respect, especially on impactful decisions like these. Your approach dismisses your wife's involvement and feelings as your niece's guardian, which is hurtful and unfair.

You are not obligated to include your stepmother and stepsiblings in a special moment that you have already chosen to share with your full sisters. It seems like you have made decisions based on your personal relationships and comfort levels. Additionally, it sounds like there is a lot of unresolved tension and past hurt between you and your family, which might be contributing to this situation. Your choice to focus on the dance with your full sisters doesn't make you an asshole, especially since you're not excluding anyone maliciously, but rather going with what feels meaningful to you. It's your wedding, and you have the right to choose who you want to share significant moments with.

Title: AITA for telling my parents respect goes both ways, and denying them access to my children?

Post Text:
I (F32) have two wonderful children (M6 and F4) with my husband (M35) of eight years. It is important to note that I am white, while my husband is an immigrant to my country and was born and raised in Türkiye.

My parents (M60 and F57) have never taken a shining to my husband, and it has been a rocky road, but everyone is civil. That being said, there was a bit of drama when naming our children as my husband and I wanted names that honoured both cultures and would be easy to pronounce for everyone in both languages. Think Omar, Nadia, Adam, etc. My parents vehemently disagreed with our choices, specifically when it came to our son's name, and they made that very clear.

This story mostly centres around my son - the child with the name they dislike the most. I recently overheard my dad talking to my son, and he used an absolutely butchered nickname which I had never heard before. My son told my dad he didn't like it, and my dad told him that he should get used to it because everyone at school will use the name.

I intervened at that point and asked my dad what he thought he was doing. My dad said that since my husband and I had chosen an "exotic name" (his words), it was not his fault that there would be "horrible and ridiculous nicknames" that come out of it. I said that any name, "exotic" or not, could have some kind of horrible nickname come from it, and as an adult he should have stopped using the nickname when my son said that he didn't like it.

My dad's argument was that a bully at school wouldn't stop if my son said to stop, and we needed to teach my son now that by telling people to stop, it will only egg them on. He also said that he wouldn't be surprised if the teachers also started using the nickname, and that children should expect to be mocked. I asked my dad if he was comparing his behaviour to a bully, and he said no, he was teaching my son to toughen up. My dad said that it wasn't his fault we couldn't pick "a good old English name, like Henry or Robert."

I was so mad. I told my dad that if he expected to be respected by our family unit, we all deserved respect in return, and that mocking a child's name was beyond the pale. My mom, who had been listening to our conversation, stepped in and said that my dad wasn't mocking my son, he was giving him a taste of the future and we should be thankful to them for showing us what a bad choice we had made "while there is still time to change it."

I kicked both my parents out of my home, and told them that they were not welcome back until they could apologise to my son and use his real name when talking to/about him. Now my sister (F29) has been sending me messages saying that I need to be aware that they "come from a different time" and I shouldn't seperate children from their grandparents. She said I could have had a discussion with my dad without barring them from my home and family, and I have hurt them beyond belief just in time for Christmas we all should be together. Was I too harsh?

Your judgment:
--- Reply from openai/gpt-4o ---
NTA (Not The Asshole) - You have every right to expect your parents to respect both your children and the choices you and your husband make for them, including their names. Your father's insistence on using a nickname your son dislikes is disrespectful and undermines your parental authority. Moreover, the justification that it will prepare your son for potential bullying is flawed, as empowering a child to stand up for themselves is more effective than conditioning them to accept ridicule. You've set a boundary to protect your son, and expecting an apology is reasonable. While your parents come from a different time, that does not excuse hurtful behavior or disregard for your family's cultural choices. Your sister's concerns about family unity are understandable, but they should not come at the cost of your son's well-being or your family's respect.

Title: AITA for not wanting to have another wedding?

Post Text:
My husband and I had always had a plan to have a real wedding and celebration. We got married 10 years ago and we didn’t have any guests it was a simple justice of the peace wedding. At the time he didn’t really like my family because his in his eyes are “perfect” and mine aren’t as “professional” as his. He has been talking about us having a real wedding and I am very much against the idea because I recently lost my dad and he can’t walk me down the aisle. He has been very adamant that his dad could walk me down but to me that is not the purpose or point at all. I refused to get married and now it’s a huge fight where he is not speaking to me but we are already married own a house have a kid etc… am I the a hole?

Your husband is being insensitive to your feelings about your father's passing and seems to be missing the emotional significance of the situation entirely. His suggestion that his father could walk you down the aisle instead shows a concerning lack of empathy and understanding of why this is important to you.

Furthermore, the background information about him previously looking down on your family for not being "professional" enough raises red flags about his attitudes and values. It seems he may have been the one who initially prevented a larger wedding due to his judgment of your family, and now that it suits him, he wants to have one - but without considering your emotional needs and losses.

You're already married, and while vow renewals can be beautiful celebrations, they should be something both partners want. You have valid emotional reasons for not wanting this ceremony, particularly after losing your father. Your husband's silent treatment over this issue is manipulative and immature, especially considering you're already married with a house and child. He's trying to force you into something you don't want, which makes him clearly the asshole in this situation.

Title: AITA for telling my parents that my siblings and I did not turn out fine?

Post Text:
I’m catching flak from this from all sides, but I also don’t think I was necessarily wrong, so I lay the decision before you, oh oracles of AHness.

Background: I (24F) have 2 siblings, Lena (18F) and Mark (17M). Our parents divorced when I was 15 and they were 9 and 8, so I was old enough to recognize a lot of ugliness in both our parents before, during, and afterward that they were too young to see. It permanently changed my image of my parents and I have little respect for them. I worked hard to become independent as soon as possible so my parents have never had the leverage to try to force me to play nice with blended families or any of the other BS that happens. So, we all have strained relationships, but I’ve made it clear that I will walk if they push. We can have lunch or talk on the phone without too much issue usually. My siblings are a mess from everything that happened, though, in very concerning ways and I’m genuinely worried about what happens to them in the adult world.

The problem: Lena is currently pregnant, the father bailed, so she’s going to need a lot of help. My parents agreed to go to family therapy with her to work out their issues enough to be able to cooperate as grandparents. She asked me to come too. The first session was last week and I wasn’t planning on saying much, but my dad made a comment that struck a nerve. He said “Our kids have turned out fine so I don’t think we’ll have too much trouble helping raise a grandchild.” I couldn’t stop myself from laughing because it was so ridiculous. The therapist asked what I thought so I said something like “You and I barely speak to each other, Lena has an ED and anxiety so bad she cries anytime the wind picks up, and Mark is a proto-incel with anger issues. What universe are you living in that you think we turned out ok?”

Now everyone is furious with me. My dad says I’m an AH and demands an apology. My mom says she knows they messed up in some ways but it’s cruel to say those things about my siblings. My sister said I ruined any chance our parents will cooperate now since dad refuses to go to another session. I’m conflicted, but I do think my parents needed their “it’s FINE!” bubble burst. It might have been bad timing.

Your response, while perhaps blunt and delivered at an inopportune moment, was an honest reaction to your father's unrealistic statement. Family therapy is a place for addressing truths and working through issues, and your parents need to face the reality of how their actions have affected their children. Your siblings' struggles are serious, and pretending everything is fine won't help anyone. While it may have been painful to hear, your intention was likely to push your parents toward acknowledging the challenges their children faced as a first step to making things better. Your family's reaction, while understandable, doesn't change the fact that the truth needed to be addressed.

Title: AITA for refusing to continue to babysit my niece and nephew?

Post Text:
My (35F) husband, Dustin (42M) and I have three kids, all boys ages 7, 5 and 8 months. My brother Chris (37M) and sister in law Rachel (33F) have two kids 4F and 2M. I’ve taken an extended maternity after my most recent delivery due to some complications and won’t be back at work until after the new year. My husband went back when our little one was 4 months. 

Chris and Rachel came to my husband and I about 2 months ago saying their daycare could no longer keep them as the center was closing unexpectedly and they were in a bind and asked if I could watch the kids while they worked. I told them I would be willing to so long as it was temporary and not long term. Both assured me they were seeking out a new center that could take them both. Both were appreciative of our help as they were told on a Wednesday the center’s last day of operation would be that same Friday.

The first few weeks were fine but as it’s been longer and longer, my husband and I are staring to doubt they are actually looking for a new center. They’ve never offered to pay me for watching the kids, but I’ve never asked either. Until this past weekend. We took all the kids to a park on Saturday and I spoke with my brother about whether or jot they had found a mew daycare. He said they had done some tours but were told there weren’t spaces for the kids yet and had been wait listed. I told him I completely understood and reminded him me keeping the kids was supposed to be temporary. I asked him if he and Rachel could start paying me $100/week for both kids. He called me outrageous for even asking citing “we’re family.” 

I tried explaining how much more money my husband and I were spending having them in the house 5 days a week and he called me lazy for still being on leave when my baby is 8 months old. At this point, I told him I would no longer be watching the kids and not to bring them Monday (yesterday) morning. Since Saturday, Chris and Rachel have blasted Dustin and I on social media which has caused all kinds of friends and extended family to reach out, many calling us assholes amongst other things. Their post made them look like victims. When my mom reached out I explain the above and she’s now on on mine and Dustin’s side. Rachel, Rachel’s sister, and my brother have continued to text Dustin and I about what selfish assholes we are for not helping them in their time of need. 

Dustin and I are really having a hard time wrapping our heads around us being the assholes in this situation so we figured we’d ask Reddit who the assholes are here.

--- Reply from anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet ---
NTA - Here's why:

1. You agreed to help temporarily in an emergency situation, and were clear about those terms from the start.

2. You've been watching their children for 2 months without compensation, which is already extremely generous.

3. $100/week for two children is an incredibly low rate for childcare - most daycare centers charge significantly more than that per child.

4. Your brother and SIL are taking advantage of your generosity and showing entitled behavior by:
   - Expecting indefinite free childcare
   - Getting angry when asked for a minimal contribution
   - Using the "but we're family" guilt trip
   - Criticizing your maternity leave
   - Publicly shaming you on social media

5. You have three children of your own, including an infant, and are recovering from complications. Taking care of two additional young children is a significant burden.

Your brother and SIL are behaving entitled and manipulative by trying to shame you publicly instead of accepting that they need to make proper childcare arrangements. They're taking advantage of your kindness and trying to make you feel guilty for setting reasonable boundaries. The fact that they immediately resorted to social media harassment shows they're more interested in playing the victim than finding a real solution.

Title: AITA for “dressing up” too much at my kids school.

Post Text:
I F42 was told by my husband M51 that I shouldn’t dress up to go to our child’s elementary school. 

I love fashion and do tend to dress up. I don’t like wearing jeans ( I don’t like the feel and it’s hot we’re I live). So I wear a lot of skirts(usually tea length or to the knee and trouser type pants. I love finding interesting prints and cuts. I usually wear heels and only wear active wear to the gym.  I’ve spent a lot of hours cultivating my wardrobe.  I volunteer at my daughters school often, am on the PTO board,and do pick up and drop off so I’m there a lot and the teachers know me pretty well.  I’m also one of the older moms in elementary and my husband is the oldest dad. 

We were at an awards ceremony. I was wearing a printed jumpsuit with an asymmetrical neckline. One of the teachers told me I always look like I just walked of the set of Sex and the City.  I took it as a compliment, since it’s an iconic show. My husband said it wasn’t and she is saying I’m always over dressed.  He also said the other parents don’t appreciate me trying to show off since they mostly wear jeans or active wear. 

My husband is retired and rarely dressed up. Which is fine with me, especially since he had to wear a suit everyday for 30 years. It’s all personal preference I think.  I just prefer different.  He use to love my style, but seems over it since he retired.  So should I be dressing more like other parents?

Your judgment:
--- Reply from anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet ---
NTA. Your clothing choices sound appropriate and professional, not revealing or inappropriate for a school setting. You're dressing in a way that makes you comfortable and confident, and there's nothing wrong with that. The fact that other parents dress more casually doesn't mean you have to change your style.

A few key points:
1. Your described outfits (tea-length skirts, trouser pants, jumpsuits) are perfectly appropriate for a school setting
2. You're not breaking any dress codes
3. Your style is part of your identity and self-expression
4. The teacher's comment could be interpreted either way, but doesn't sound malicious
5. Your husband's reaction seems to stem from his own changed relationship with formal clothing post-retirement

Your husband's concern about "showing off" suggests he might be projecting his own insecurities or discomfort onto you. Other parents' clothing choices shouldn't dictate yours, and there's nothing wrong with taking pride in your appearance. As long as your outfits are appropriate for the setting (which they sound like they are), you're not being an asshole by dressing in your preferred style.

Your husband is being insensitive to your feelings about your father's passing and showing a concerning lack of empathy. His previous judgment of your family as not being "professional" enough and now pushing his father as a replacement for yours shows a pattern of dismissiveness towards your family connections and feelings.

The fact that he's now giving you the silent treatment over this is manipulative and immature, especially considering you're already married with a house and child. A vow renewal or second ceremony should be something both partners want and agree to, not something one person pressures the other into.

Additionally, his sudden desire for a "real wedding" after previously looking down on your family raises questions about his motivations. If he wanted a big celebration, he should have been open to it 10 years ago instead of judging your family as not good enough.

Your emotional connection to wanting your father to be part of such an important ceremony is completely valid, and your husband should be more understanding of why this is a sensitive issue for you, especially following your recent loss.

Title: AITA for telling my coworker I won't block his wife just because he told me to?

Post Text:
AITA for telling my coworker I won't block his wife in social-media just because he told me to?

So, last month I (F30) went with my friends (F, 29, 31 and 33) to the movie theater to watch a concert of my favorite artist. I ran into a co-worker (M36) and his wife (early 20s). I always thought I got along fine with my co-worker , but I wouldn’t go as far to call him my friend. I went to say hi to him and he introduced me to his wife, let’s call her Vivian.

Later during the concert (keep in mind that while we have assigned seats in the theater, nobody was sitting, it  was anarchy) I noticed VIvian was alone, so I approached her and asked her about my co-worker and she said he left because he was bored. I kind of felt bad for her, so I told her if she wanted she could join our group, she ended up spending the rest of the concert with us, after the theater we all went to have dinner, we bonded with VIvian over our love for the artist, and by the end of the night we all ended up adding her in social media. 

That’s the one and only time I have seen her in person, and our interaction in social media is just tagging each other (and the rest of the group) in news about the artist we both love. This Sunday she posted pictures of a batch of cookies she was making. I commented they looked delicious, and she sent me a PM saying she actually made A LOT of cookies, she said she could send me some with my coworker if I wanted. I saw nothing wrong with this so I accepted. 

Well my coworker gave me the cookies yesterday, and he said that  until Vivian  gave him the cookies for me, he didn’t know we had kept in touch, but he didn’t like it, so I need to block her now and never speak to her again. This caught me by surprise, while we have never been friends, we have always been polite to each other and I can’t think of a reason why he would want me to block his wife. I don’t have a reputation of being problematic or anything like that in the office. I don’t keep up with the office gossip, in case he is worried I’m going to tell her what he is up to. In case he is worried I’m Ms-Steal-Your-Girl, I’m  not a home-wrecker and I’m straight anyway.

Anyway, I was too surprised to actually give him a good reply, so I just told him he doesn’t get to tell me what to do, that I’m not going to block someone just because he told me to, that if he has a problem he can discuss this with his wife. 
Now, I’m second guessing if this was the right thing to do. Maybe I was too harsh, and I could have talked about it with him. Maybe I’m creating unnecessary drama. AITA?

Your judgment:
--- Reply from anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet ---
NTA

Your coworker is being controlling and unreasonable. You met his wife in a completely innocent situation, bonded over shared interests, and have maintained a perfectly appropriate, casual social media friendship. The cookie exchange was wholesome and innocent.

His demand that you block his wife raises several red flags:
1. He's trying to control who his wife can be friends with
2. He's attempting to extend that control to you, a coworker
3. He abandoned his wife at a concert and now seems upset that she made friends there
4. He's making unreasonable demands without any explanation or justification

You handled it appropriately by:
1. Setting a clear boundary that he can't dictate your social media connections
2. Directing him to discuss any concerns with his wife directly
3. Maintaining purely platonic, appropriate interactions with his wife

The age gap between him and his wife, combined with his controlling behavior, is concerning. You're not creating drama - he is. You have no obligation to cut off an innocent friendship just because he's insecure or controlling. If he has specific concerns, he needs to address them with his wife, not make demands of his coworkers.

Title: AITA for planning a spotlight dance with just my full sisters and not my stepmother or step and half siblings?

Post Text:
I (25M) will be getting married to my amazing fiancée Dove (25F) in March. Dove always knew she wanted a spotlighted dance with both her parents and not just the typical father-daughter dance. When she told me this I decided to ask my sisters (24F, 23F) if they would do a spotlight dance with me after Dove and her family. They jumped at the chance and we started to practice. We know what song we'll be dancing to and we've pretty much got our routine down.

My stepmother asked me several weeks ago if I was going to ask her to do a mother-son dance at the wedding. She made it clear she had expected to be asked before that point and was asking herself because she was tired of waiting. I told her I was not asking her. She asked if I was really going to sit there and watch Dove dance with her parents and refuse to do one because my mom died 14 years ago. I told my stepmother that I was not going to just sit there because my sisters and I were doing one together. She stormed off after that.

A couple of weeks later my father and stepmother asked me why I said I was dancing with my sisters when my stepsister (21F) and half sisters (13F, 9F) had never been asked. I told them I asked my two full sisters and the three of us were doing it together and my step and half siblings (I have a stepbrother and two half brothers too) were not included in that. They asked me how that was supposed to make them feel. My stepmother told me that her kids had always felt like they could not get close to my sisters and me because we had an impenetrable barrier between us and any other siblings who would have come into our lives. She said it was horrible that we lost our mom but our family grew and instead of coming together and leaning on having a bigger family, we kept it to just us and we have never viewed her kids as siblings in any real way. She said she has also tried her best to be a good bonus mother and we have never viewed her as anything more than the woman our father is married to.

My father said he felt like he failed us. I told him he had, repeatedly, and at least he was finally admitting it. I told him when you emotionally and physically abandon your three children who are on the cusp of losing their mother and continue to abandon them afterward, it is a failure to them and he should come to terms with that.

They said that was all true but be that as it may, it doesn't mean we shouldn't reach out to embrace and love the newer members of our family and the wedding dance could be a perfect way to cut step and half and just all be siblings. I told them I did not want that. They told me I was then worse than my father and my actions were more cruel.

I should say this is the most we have spoken in years. I am low contact with them usually and they are not a big part of my life.

AITA?

Your wedding is your special day, and you have every right to choose who participates in special moments like spotlight dances. The dance you're planning with your full sisters clearly has deep emotional significance, likely connected to your shared experience of losing your mother and supporting each other through that difficult time.

Your stepmother and father are trying to force a family dynamic that never naturally developed, largely due to your father's own failures during a critical time in your life. They're attempting to use emotional manipulation to make you feel guilty about having a special bond with your full sisters, while completely dismissing the trauma and abandonment you experienced.

The fact that they're calling you "worse than your father" for not including step-siblings in a wedding dance is particularly manipulative, especially given that you maintain low contact with them for presumably good reasons. They're trying to use your wedding as a tool to force relationships that they failed to nurture properly over the years.

It's not cruel to want a special moment with the sisters who shared your journey through the loss of your mother. Your stepmother and father are the ones being unreasonable by trying to force artificial closeness through what should be a meaningful personal choice at your own wedding.

Title: WIBTA for asking my friend to return the expensive wedding gift I gave her after she and her fiancé broke up?

Post Text:
About three weeks ago, my friend broke up with her fiancé a month before their wedding (would have been this weekend). She found him fooling around with another girl and called off the wedding. It’s a huge mess and I feel awful for her. It truly is a devastating time for her and I’ve been as supportive as possible through it all. 

She has been one of my closest friends for the past 15ish years and she is basically a sister to me. Because of this, when I found out they were engaged at the beginning of the year, I wanted to give her a truly special wedding gift. She has always been into interior designing and has wanted an Eames lounge chair for a long time. I found one for $4500, which was a good deal, so I got it for her. Im fortunate to be able to afford this, but it’s still quite a lot. She was ugly crying when I told her about it and she was extremely grateful for it. However, now that the wedding is called off, I’m not sure what to do. I could still use that money if I were to get it back…

Is it rude to ask for her to return it or at least pay me back for the chair? I feel like I would be such an asshole for doing so, but some other friends (who aren’t close to her) said she absolutely should at least return it so I can get my money back. She’s going through a lot now, so I don’t want to press her too much and honestly if I never see the money again, that’s fine. But still, $4500 is a good amount of change that I would be happy to have if possible.

Edit: thanks for all the replies so far. I realized I left out a very important detail which is the time frame to return the chair is 90 days, so that’s why I’m asking this question now. I bought the chair in mid September, so that to return and get the full refund is coming up in about a month. 

To address some other comments, you all are right about asking about just asking her for money, which is dumb and I will not do that. The big reason why I even asked the question was due to my conversation with other friends who said she should return it. 

Ultimately, I will not ask her to do anything and she can keep the chair, no problem. If she does get married again tho… maybe I’ll just buy her some nice chocolate then lol. Thanks everyone!

--- Reply from anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet ---
NAH - This is a delicate situation with valid feelings on all sides. 

The gift-giver's hesitation is understandable given the substantial amount ($4500) and the fact that it was specifically a wedding gift for an event that won't happen. The added detail about the 90-day return window makes their consideration even more reasonable.

However, the friend is also not an asshole here - she's the victim of infidelity and is going through an incredibly difficult time. The gift was given with love and received with genuine gratitude.

The gift-giver's ultimate decision (as stated in their edit) to let the friend keep the chair is the right call. Once a gift is given, it generally shouldn't be taken back, especially from someone going through trauma. The thought of asking for its return is understandable given the circumstances, but actually doing so would likely damage a 15-year friendship that seems quite meaningful to both parties.

This is one of those situations where there's no perfect answer, but everyone's feelings and motivations are reasonable. The OP showed good judgment in seeking advice and ultimately deciding to prioritize the friendship over the money.

Your brother and SIL are taking advantage of your generosity in multiple ways:

1. They agreed this would be temporary but show no urgency in finding alternative care
2. They never offered any compensation for watching their children for 2+ months
3. When you reasonably asked for a modest amount ($100/week for two children is extremely cheap for childcare), they attacked you personally
4. They resorted to public shaming on social media when you set boundaries
5. They insulted you for being on maternity leave, which is completely inappropriate given your medical complications

You're already caring for three children including an infant while recovering from complications. Watching two additional young children is a significant responsibility and burden. $100/week for two children is far below market rate for childcare, making it a very reasonable request.

Their "we're family" argument is manipulative - family should be more willing to compensate family fairly, not expect free services indefinitely. The fact that they responded with hostility, personal attacks, and public shaming when you set reasonable boundaries shows they were taking advantage of your kindness.

You gave them ample warning this was temporary, communicated clearly, and even tried to continue helping for a modest fee. Their response was completely inappropriate and entitled. You're definitely not the asshole here.

Title: WIBTA for asking my friend to return the expensive wedding gift I gave her after she and her fiancé broke up?

Post Text:
About three weeks ago, my friend broke up with her fiancé a month before their wedding (would have been this weekend). She found him fooling around with another girl and called off the wedding. It’s a huge mess and I feel awful for her. It truly is a devastating time for her and I’ve been as supportive as possible through it all. 

She has been one of my closest friends for the past 15ish years and she is basically a sister to me. Because of this, when I found out they were engaged at the beginning of the year, I wanted to give her a truly special wedding gift. She has always been into interior designing and has wanted an Eames lounge chair for a long time. I found one for $4500, which was a good deal, so I got it for her. Im fortunate to be able to afford this, but it’s still quite a lot. She was ugly crying when I told her about it and she was extremely grateful for it. However, now that the wedding is called off, I’m not sure what to do. I could still use that money if I were to get it back…

Is it rude to ask for her to return it or at least pay me back for the chair? I feel like I would be such an asshole for doing so, but some other friends (who aren’t close to her) said she absolutely should at least return it so I can get my money back. She’s going through a lot now, so I don’t want to press her too much and honestly if I never see the money again, that’s fine. But still, $4500 is a good amount of change that I would be happy to have if possible.

Edit: thanks for all the replies so far. I realized I left out a very important detail which is the time frame to return the chair is 90 days, so that’s why I’m asking this question now. I bought the chair in mid September, so that to return and get the full refund is coming up in about a month. 

To address some other comments, you all are right about asking about just asking her for money, which is dumb and I will not do that. The big reason why I even asked the question was due to my conversation with other friends who said she should return it. 

Ultimately, I will not ask her to do anything and she can keep the chair, no problem. If she does get married again tho… maybe I’ll just buy her some nice chocolate then lol. Thanks everyone!

ESH (Everyone Sucks Here)

Here's why:

The friends suggesting she should ask for the return are being insensitive to someone going through a traumatic breakup due to infidelity. They're treating this like a simple transaction when it's much more complex emotionally.

The OP sucks (though mildly) for even considering asking for the return/repayment of what was presented as a gift. Once you give a gift, it's given - regardless of what happens afterward. The fact that it was expensive doesn't change the nature of gift-giving. Additionally, asking someone who just discovered their fiancé's infidelity to repay $4,500 would be adding financial stress to emotional trauma.

However, the timing detail about the 90-day return window does add some complexity. The OP could have approached this differently by explaining this window to the friend and letting her make her own decision, rather than considering asking for the money back directly.

That said, the OP's edit shows growth and understanding, ultimately making the right decision to let the friend keep the chair. The lesson learned about being more moderate with future wedding gifts is also appropriate.

The final verdict of ESH is mainly due to everyone (OP and friends) treating what should be a supportive moment for the friend as a financial transaction instead.

Title: AITA for telling my parents that my siblings and I did not turn out fine?

Post Text:
I’m catching flak from this from all sides, but I also don’t think I was necessarily wrong, so I lay the decision before you, oh oracles of AHness.

Background: I (24F) have 2 siblings, Lena (18F) and Mark (17M). Our parents divorced when I was 15 and they were 9 and 8, so I was old enough to recognize a lot of ugliness in both our parents before, during, and afterward that they were too young to see. It permanently changed my image of my parents and I have little respect for them. I worked hard to become independent as soon as possible so my parents have never had the leverage to try to force me to play nice with blended families or any of the other BS that happens. So, we all have strained relationships, but I’ve made it clear that I will walk if they push. We can have lunch or talk on the phone without too much issue usually. My siblings are a mess from everything that happened, though, in very concerning ways and I’m genuinely worried about what happens to them in the adult world.

The problem: Lena is currently pregnant, the father bailed, so she’s going to need a lot of help. My parents agreed to go to family therapy with her to work out their issues enough to be able to cooperate as grandparents. She asked me to come too. The first session was last week and I wasn’t planning on saying much, but my dad made a comment that struck a nerve. He said “Our kids have turned out fine so I don’t think we’ll have too much trouble helping raise a grandchild.” I couldn’t stop myself from laughing because it was so ridiculous. The therapist asked what I thought so I said something like “You and I barely speak to each other, Lena has an ED and anxiety so bad she cries anytime the wind picks up, and Mark is a proto-incel with anger issues. What universe are you living in that you think we turned out ok?”

Now everyone is furious with me. My dad says I’m an AH and demands an apology. My mom says she knows they messed up in some ways but it’s cruel to say those things about my siblings. My sister said I ruined any chance our parents will cooperate now since dad refuses to go to another session. I’m conflicted, but I do think my parents needed their “it’s FINE!” bubble burst. It might have been bad timing.

While the delivery was harsh, this was a therapy session - exactly the place where hard truths need to come out. The father's comment about everyone turning out "fine" was both delusional and potentially harmful, as it dismisses very real issues that need to be addressed, especially with a grandchild coming into the picture.

The OP wasn't just being vindictive; she was responding to a false narrative that could undermine the entire purpose of the therapy sessions. Her siblings are clearly struggling with serious issues (eating disorder, anxiety, anger management), and pretending otherwise won't help anyone, least of all the incoming baby.

The father's reaction - refusing to attend further sessions because someone spoke the truth - demonstrates exactly why this family needs therapy. He'd rather maintain his comfortable illusion than face reality and work on actual solutions.

While the timing might seem unfortunate given the need for family cooperation with the upcoming baby, enabling denial would be worse in the long run. Real healing and positive change can only happen when people acknowledge the actual problems they're facing. The OP's outburst, while blunt, was honest and necessary in a therapeutic setting.

Title: AITA for “dressing up” too much at my kids school.

Post Text:
I F42 was told by my husband M51 that I shouldn’t dress up to go to our child’s elementary school. 

I love fashion and do tend to dress up. I don’t like wearing jeans ( I don’t like the feel and it’s hot we’re I live). So I wear a lot of skirts(usually tea length or to the knee and trouser type pants. I love finding interesting prints and cuts. I usually wear heels and only wear active wear to the gym.  I’ve spent a lot of hours cultivating my wardrobe.  I volunteer at my daughters school often, am on the PTO board,and do pick up and drop off so I’m there a lot and the teachers know me pretty well.  I’m also one of the older moms in elementary and my husband is the oldest dad. 

We were at an awards ceremony. I was wearing a printed jumpsuit with an asymmetrical neckline. One of the teachers told me I always look like I just walked of the set of Sex and the City.  I took it as a compliment, since it’s an iconic show. My husband said it wasn’t and she is saying I’m always over dressed.  He also said the other parents don’t appreciate me trying to show off since they mostly wear jeans or active wear. 

My husband is retired and rarely dressed up. Which is fine with me, especially since he had to wear a suit everyday for 30 years. It’s all personal preference I think.  I just prefer different.  He use to love my style, but seems over it since he retired.  So should I be dressing more like other parents?

Your judgment:

You're dressing in a way that makes you feel comfortable and confident, and there's nothing inappropriate about your clothing choices. The outfits you described (tea-length skirts, trousers, jumpsuits) are perfectly suitable for a school environment. You're not wearing anything revealing or inappropriate; you simply have a more polished style.

The Sex and the City comment could indeed be taken as a compliment, and even if it wasn't meant as one, it's not your responsibility to dress down just because others choose to wear more casual clothing. Your husband's interpretation seems to stem from his own changed relationship with formal clothing since retiring, and he's projecting that onto you.

It's concerning that your husband is suggesting you should change your personal style to make others feel more comfortable. As long as you're wearing appropriate clothing (which you are), other parents' potential insecurities about your fashion choices are not your problem to solve.

You're an active, involved parent who happens to enjoy fashion. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, and you shouldn't have to change your authentic self to match others' casual dress preferences.

Title: AITA for saying to my wife that I’m the one who gets to make decisions about my niece?

Post Text:
My (43M) niece (14F) is being raised by my wife (40F) and I - it’s a long story, having to do with my sister getting herself pregnant from a deadbeat and proving overall unfit to be a mother. Bottom line is, I see my niece as my daughter and love her just as much as my own biological children (11M/8M). I know my wife also loves her the same way, however I’m legally my niece's sole legal guardian.

My niece has practiced gymnastics for the past 10 years, and when she was about 7 or 8 one of the coaches at her gym took notice of her potential and suggested she could really make it as a professional athlete. I personally believe my wife and my niece/daughter were taken by this promise of future glory (“can you imagine if she competes in the Olympics one day?”, my wife said). I was always VERY cautious because I do realize the shots are slim; I also knew that could cost us a lot of money going forward, but the coach believed so much in her that they managed to cover some of the costs of her training on the gym’s dime.

And when I say training, I mean TRAINING – some serious hard work. I told them I was fine with the idea as long my niece was happy doing gymnastics and it didn’t majorly impact her life. And then, last month, she tore her ACL during practice. We do have insurance, so the medical costs were covered. However, she’s going through a painful recovery, all the while wondering when she’ll be healthy enough to get back to the gym. But I told my wife I don’t want her to do this anymore. Seeing her get hurt and in pain made me realize this is a dangerous sport, and the toll it's taking on her body is simply not worth it.

My wife said I couldn’t make this decision without considering what my niece wants; I said I can because I’m the adult here and she’s still a child. So my wife said there was still the matter of her disagreeing with my view, and that we were supposed to make this parenting decisions together. I then said that's true regarding our boys, but not when it comes to my niece. All I meant is that I'm the sole guardian in the sense of being responsible for her; what my wife got is that I was undermining her as a surrogate mother. AITA here?

Edit: some additional information, to be clear, I still haven't talked to my niece about this. I shared with my wife that, given the severity of her injury, I didn't want her training anymore. This discussion was between my wife and I, it didn't involve our girl so far.

YTA

While your concern for your niece's well-being is understandable, there are several problematic aspects to your approach:

1. Using your legal guardianship status to override your wife's parental input is manipulative and disrespectful. Your wife has been helping raise this child and should have equal say in parenting decisions.

2. Making a unilateral decision about a 14-year-old's passion without even consulting her is inappropriate. At her age, she deserves to have input about activities that are important to her life.

3. All sports carry injury risks, and ACL tears, while serious, are common injuries that many athletes recover from. Using one injury as justification to completely end her athletic career seems extreme.

4. Most concerning is how you're weaponizing your legal guardian status against your wife, essentially telling her that her role as a mother figure doesn't matter. This could damage both your marriage and your family dynamic.

Instead of making unilateral decisions, you should:
- Have a family discussion including your niece
- Consult with doctors about safe recovery and return to sport
- Consider your wife an equal partner in parenting decisions
- Look for ways to make the sport safer rather than ending it completely

Your concern is valid, but your approach to handling it makes you TA in this situation.

Title: AITAH for wanting to be on deed of girlfriends (legally speaking) house?

Post Text:
AITAH for wanting to be on the deed of girlfriends house?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for close to 7 years, I love her very much and we are generally great together. We plan to get married at some point and openly discuss it, yet we do not put much emphasis on the whole thing so have no solid plans. We live in a fairly affluent coastal CT town, where I have grown up.

I had a family friend offer to sell me his house off market in 2022. Sort of out of the blue. Unfortunately, I had just quit my job at that point so when it came time to qualify for a mortgage I was unable to be a part of that. She was able to qualify for the asking price by herself. The plan was that we would split the down payment even (15k each). As well as the mortgage ($1300 per month). We then purchased the house! We feel lucky because it was a good deal and in a great neighborhood. Since then, we all know the real estate market has only became more inflated and interest rates have sky rocketed.

We split EVERYTHING even, including all maintenance and improvements. We have had a lot of work done on the house, I would estimate I have spent another 10k personally on improvements, she has done the same. We have also put a TON of sweat equity into the house, endless nights and weekends fixing the house up. 

I am now paying even more than her ($1500) to pay off a new kitchen oven we purchased. I will add that she insisted on a very expensive oven, where I thought a more average one would be sufficient. 

I am starting to feel uneasy because I am in the hole close to 30k, not including equity from paying half of the mortgage. If she were to decide that she does not want to be with me anymore, I could be kicked to the curb and have no legal recourse to get my investment back. I am not saying she would not make an effort to pay me back but I know she does not have the funds to do so. 

I have recently said that I am not comfortable investing anymore money into the house until I legally own it. She will not put me on the deed. She wants me on the mortgage to be put on the deed although it does not make sense to refinance now or for the foreseeable future as the interest rate would be much higher than what we are locked in at. At this point I feel like this is boarder line financial abuse and I do not feel good about the situation. She says when the interest rates go down we can refinance and add me to the mortgage but I do not see that happening anytime soon and it is not a concrete. We are even on everything financially speaking and I think it would be fair to put me on the deed. :(

Your concern is completely valid. You've invested a significant amount of money (around $30,000) plus ongoing mortgage payments and sweat equity into a property that you legally have no claim to. While your girlfriend's position about wanting you on the mortgage if you're on the deed might make sense from her perspective, the current market conditions make this impossible without significantly increasing your monthly payments through refinancing.

The fact that you're splitting all costs equally but don't have any legal protection for your investment is concerning. If the relationship were to end, you would essentially be treated as a tenant who made improvements to someone else's property, despite having contributed to the down payment and ongoing costs equally.

A reasonable solution would be to have a legal agreement drawn up (like a contract or deed of trust) that protects your financial investment in the property, even if you're not on the deed. This would give you legal recourse to recover your investment if things go wrong, while not requiring a refinance at current high rates.

Your girlfriend's unwillingness to consider alternative solutions to protect your investment, while continuing to accept your equal contributions to the property, is unfair. This isn't about trust in the relationship - it's about having reasonable legal protections for a significant financial investment.

Your response in therapy was brutally honest but necessary, especially in that setting. The purpose of family therapy is to address and work through issues, not to maintain comfortable delusions. Your father's comment about everyone turning out "fine" was a clear attempt to minimize the very real problems that led to the need for therapy in the first place.

The fact that:
1. Your 18-year-old sister has an eating disorder and severe anxiety
2. Your brother has concerning behavioral issues
3. You maintain only minimal contact with your parents
4. Your teenage sister is pregnant and needs family support

All of these points demonstrate that things are NOT "fine," and pretending otherwise would be counterproductive to the therapy process.

While your delivery might have been harsh, your father's refusal to continue therapy because someone pointed out reality shows exactly why your family needs it. He's more concerned with maintaining his comfortable fiction than addressing the actual problems affecting his children.

The timing wasn't ideal given your sister's current situation, but your parents' unwillingness to acknowledge their role in their children's struggles would have undermined any meaningful progress in therapy anyway. Sometimes hard truths need to be spoken, especially in a therapeutic setting designed for exactly that purpose.

Title: AITA for planning a spotlight dance with just my full sisters and not my stepmother or step and half siblings?

Post Text:
I (25M) will be getting married to my amazing fiancée Dove (25F) in March. Dove always knew she wanted a spotlighted dance with both her parents and not just the typical father-daughter dance. When she told me this I decided to ask my sisters (24F, 23F) if they would do a spotlight dance with me after Dove and her family. They jumped at the chance and we started to practice. We know what song we'll be dancing to and we've pretty much got our routine down.

My stepmother asked me several weeks ago if I was going to ask her to do a mother-son dance at the wedding. She made it clear she had expected to be asked before that point and was asking herself because she was tired of waiting. I told her I was not asking her. She asked if I was really going to sit there and watch Dove dance with her parents and refuse to do one because my mom died 14 years ago. I told my stepmother that I was not going to just sit there because my sisters and I were doing one together. She stormed off after that.

A couple of weeks later my father and stepmother asked me why I said I was dancing with my sisters when my stepsister (21F) and half sisters (13F, 9F) had never been asked. I told them I asked my two full sisters and the three of us were doing it together and my step and half siblings (I have a stepbrother and two half brothers too) were not included in that. They asked me how that was supposed to make them feel. My stepmother told me that her kids had always felt like they could not get close to my sisters and me because we had an impenetrable barrier between us and any other siblings who would have come into our lives. She said it was horrible that we lost our mom but our family grew and instead of coming together and leaning on having a bigger family, we kept it to just us and we have never viewed her kids as siblings in any real way. She said she has also tried her best to be a good bonus mother and we have never viewed her as anything more than the woman our father is married to.

My father said he felt like he failed us. I told him he had, repeatedly, and at least he was finally admitting it. I told him when you emotionally and physically abandon your three children who are on the cusp of losing their mother and continue to abandon them afterward, it is a failure to them and he should come to terms with that.

They said that was all true but be that as it may, it doesn't mean we shouldn't reach out to embrace and love the newer members of our family and the wedding dance could be a perfect way to cut step and half and just all be siblings. I told them I did not want that. They told me I was then worse than my father and my actions were more cruel.

I should say this is the most we have spoken in years. I am low contact with them usually and they are not a big part of my life.

AITA?

Your wedding is your special day, and you have every right to choose who participates in special moments like spotlight dances. The dance you're planning with your full sisters appears to have deep emotional significance, likely connected to your shared experience of losing your mother and getting through that difficult time together.

Your stepmother and father are trying to force a family dynamic that was never properly cultivated. They're attempting to use your wedding as a tool to manufacture closeness that they failed to build over the years. Your father's admission of failure is telling - he abandoned you and your sisters during an incredibly vulnerable time, and now wants to pretend everything can be fixed with a wedding dance.

It's particularly manipulative for them to claim you're "worse than your father" for not including step/half siblings in this dance. They're trying to guilt you into changing your plans instead of acknowledging their role in creating this family division. The fact that you're low contact with them speaks volumes about the relationship dynamics at play.

Your stepmother's complaint about an "impenetrable barrier" ignores the reality that it was the adults' responsibility to foster healthy relationships between all the children when blending the family. Their failure to do so, especially during your time of grief, is not something you're obligated to paper over at your wedding.

The dance with your sisters sounds like a meaningful tribute to your shared history and bond. You shouldn't have to compromise that to appease others' feelings about family dynamics they helped create.

YTA - Your reasoning is problematic on multiple levels:

1. While you are legally the sole guardian, your wife has been helping raise this child for years as a mother figure. Dismissing her input in parenting decisions is disrespectful to both your wife and the family unit you've built together.

2. Most importantly, at 14, your niece is old enough to have a say in decisions about her own activities and future. Making unilateral decisions about her passion without even consulting her is controlling and could damage your relationship with her.

3. Sports injuries, while concerning, are a risk in any athletic pursuit. ACL tears, while serious, are common and recoverable injuries. Many athletes return to their sport after proper rehabilitation.

4. You're letting fear override reason. Instead of an outright ban, you could work with your niece, wife, coaches, and medical professionals to make informed decisions about safe return-to-sport protocols.

The way you're wielding your legal authority to override both your wife's and niece's input is inappropriate. Being a guardian means making decisions in the child's best interest, not making unilateral decisions without considering the input of other involved parties, especially your life partner who helps raise her.

You need to have a family discussion involving all parties and make this decision together.

Title: AITA for telling my coworker I won't block his wife just because he told me to?

Post Text:
AITA for telling my coworker I won't block his wife in social-media just because he told me to?

So, last month I (F30) went with my friends (F, 29, 31 and 33) to the movie theater to watch a concert of my favorite artist. I ran into a co-worker (M36) and his wife (early 20s). I always thought I got along fine with my co-worker , but I wouldn’t go as far to call him my friend. I went to say hi to him and he introduced me to his wife, let’s call her Vivian.

Later during the concert (keep in mind that while we have assigned seats in the theater, nobody was sitting, it  was anarchy) I noticed VIvian was alone, so I approached her and asked her about my co-worker and she said he left because he was bored. I kind of felt bad for her, so I told her if she wanted she could join our group, she ended up spending the rest of the concert with us, after the theater we all went to have dinner, we bonded with VIvian over our love for the artist, and by the end of the night we all ended up adding her in social media. 

That’s the one and only time I have seen her in person, and our interaction in social media is just tagging each other (and the rest of the group) in news about the artist we both love. This Sunday she posted pictures of a batch of cookies she was making. I commented they looked delicious, and she sent me a PM saying she actually made A LOT of cookies, she said she could send me some with my coworker if I wanted. I saw nothing wrong with this so I accepted. 

Well my coworker gave me the cookies yesterday, and he said that  until Vivian  gave him the cookies for me, he didn’t know we had kept in touch, but he didn’t like it, so I need to block her now and never speak to her again. This caught me by surprise, while we have never been friends, we have always been polite to each other and I can’t think of a reason why he would want me to block his wife. I don’t have a reputation of being problematic or anything like that in the office. I don’t keep up with the office gossip, in case he is worried I’m going to tell her what he is up to. In case he is worried I’m Ms-Steal-Your-Girl, I’m  not a home-wrecker and I’m straight anyway.

Anyway, I was too surprised to actually give him a good reply, so I just told him he doesn’t get to tell me what to do, that I’m not going to block someone just because he told me to, that if he has a problem he can discuss this with his wife. 
Now, I’m second guessing if this was the right thing to do. Maybe I was too harsh, and I could have talked about it with him. Maybe I’m creating unnecessary drama. AITA?

NTA. Your response was appropriate and reasonable. Here's why:

1. You met his wife in a completely normal social situation and included her when she was left alone by her husband at a concert.

2. Your continued interaction with her has been completely innocent - just sharing common interests about an artist and some friendly cookie-sharing.

3. The coworker's demand to block his wife is controlling behavior, both towards you and his wife. He has no right to dictate who you can be friends with.

4. The age gap (him being 36 and her being early 20s) combined with his controlling behavior raises some red flags about their relationship dynamic.

5. Your response was direct but professional - you didn't escalate the situation, you simply stated that he doesn't have the right to control your social media connections and that he should discuss any concerns with his wife directly.

You're not creating drama - he is. If he has concerns about his wife's friendships, that's something he needs to discuss with her, not demand that her friends block her. Your instinct to maintain boundaries while remaining professional was correct.

Title: AITA for telling my parents respect goes both ways, and denying them access to my children?

Post Text:
I (F32) have two wonderful children (M6 and F4) with my husband (M35) of eight years. It is important to note that I am white, while my husband is an immigrant to my country and was born and raised in Türkiye.

My parents (M60 and F57) have never taken a shining to my husband, and it has been a rocky road, but everyone is civil. That being said, there was a bit of drama when naming our children as my husband and I wanted names that honoured both cultures and would be easy to pronounce for everyone in both languages. Think Omar, Nadia, Adam, etc. My parents vehemently disagreed with our choices, specifically when it came to our son's name, and they made that very clear.

This story mostly centres around my son - the child with the name they dislike the most. I recently overheard my dad talking to my son, and he used an absolutely butchered nickname which I had never heard before. My son told my dad he didn't like it, and my dad told him that he should get used to it because everyone at school will use the name.

I intervened at that point and asked my dad what he thought he was doing. My dad said that since my husband and I had chosen an "exotic name" (his words), it was not his fault that there would be "horrible and ridiculous nicknames" that come out of it. I said that any name, "exotic" or not, could have some kind of horrible nickname come from it, and as an adult he should have stopped using the nickname when my son said that he didn't like it.

My dad's argument was that a bully at school wouldn't stop if my son said to stop, and we needed to teach my son now that by telling people to stop, it will only egg them on. He also said that he wouldn't be surprised if the teachers also started using the nickname, and that children should expect to be mocked. I asked my dad if he was comparing his behaviour to a bully, and he said no, he was teaching my son to toughen up. My dad said that it wasn't his fault we couldn't pick "a good old English name, like Henry or Robert."

I was so mad. I told my dad that if he expected to be respected by our family unit, we all deserved respect in return, and that mocking a child's name was beyond the pale. My mom, who had been listening to our conversation, stepped in and said that my dad wasn't mocking my son, he was giving him a taste of the future and we should be thankful to them for showing us what a bad choice we had made "while there is still time to change it."

I kicked both my parents out of my home, and told them that they were not welcome back until they could apologise to my son and use his real name when talking to/about him. Now my sister (F29) has been sending me messages saying that I need to be aware that they "come from a different time" and I shouldn't seperate children from their grandparents. She said I could have had a discussion with my dad without barring them from my home and family, and I have hurt them beyond belief just in time for Christmas we all should be together. Was I too harsh?

Your parents are actively undermining your parental choices and deliberately making your child uncomfortable about his own name under the guise of "preparing" him for bullying. This is particularly problematic because:

1. They're essentially engaging in the very bullying behavior they claim to be preparing him against
2. They're showing clear cultural insensitivity and racism by referring to your son's name as "exotic" and suggesting only "good old English names" are acceptable
3. They're disrespecting both your and your husband's cultural heritage and parenting decisions
4. Most importantly, they continued this behavior even after your son explicitly said he didn't like it

Your response to protect your child from this harmful behavior is completely appropriate. The "they come from a different time" excuse your sister uses is not valid - being older doesn't give anyone the right to bully a child or disrespect their cultural identity.

Setting clear boundaries and requiring an apology before allowing them access to your children is a reasonable consequence for their actions. You're not separating them from their grandchildren; they're separating themselves by choosing to behave disrespectfully and refusing to acknowledge their wrong behavior.

You're doing exactly what a good parent should do: protecting your children from people who would harm their self-esteem and cultural identity, even if those people are family members.

Your parents are actively bullying your 6-year-old son and trying to disguise it as "preparing him for the real world." This is completely unacceptable behavior from adults, especially grandparents who should be loving and supportive family members.

Several key points make you clearly NTA:

1. Your son explicitly told your father he didn't like the nickname, and your father dismissed his feelings and continued anyway
2. Your parents are demonstrating clear xenophobic attitudes toward your husband's culture by dismissing non-English names as "exotic" and problematic
3. The argument that they're "preparing him for bullying" is both harmful and illogical - adults should protect children from bullying, not participate in it
4. Their suggestion that you should change your son's name shows complete disrespect for both your parental choices and your husband's cultural heritage

Your response - requiring an apology and proper respect for your son's name before allowing them back - is not harsh; it's appropriate boundary-setting to protect your child. The "different time" excuse your sister offers doesn't justify bullying a child, and protecting your son from emotional harm is more important than maintaining holiday traditions with people who disrespect him.

You're doing exactly what a good parent should do: protecting your child from harmful behavior, regardless of who the perpetrator is.

Title: AITAH for wanting to be on deed of girlfriends (legally speaking) house?

Post Text:
AITAH for wanting to be on the deed of girlfriends house?

My girlfriend and I have been dating for close to 7 years, I love her very much and we are generally great together. We plan to get married at some point and openly discuss it, yet we do not put much emphasis on the whole thing so have no solid plans. We live in a fairly affluent coastal CT town, where I have grown up.

I had a family friend offer to sell me his house off market in 2022. Sort of out of the blue. Unfortunately, I had just quit my job at that point so when it came time to qualify for a mortgage I was unable to be a part of that. She was able to qualify for the asking price by herself. The plan was that we would split the down payment even (15k each). As well as the mortgage ($1300 per month). We then purchased the house! We feel lucky because it was a good deal and in a great neighborhood. Since then, we all know the real estate market has only became more inflated and interest rates have sky rocketed.

We split EVERYTHING even, including all maintenance and improvements. We have had a lot of work done on the house, I would estimate I have spent another 10k personally on improvements, she has done the same. We have also put a TON of sweat equity into the house, endless nights and weekends fixing the house up. 

I am now paying even more than her ($1500) to pay off a new kitchen oven we purchased. I will add that she insisted on a very expensive oven, where I thought a more average one would be sufficient. 

I am starting to feel uneasy because I am in the hole close to 30k, not including equity from paying half of the mortgage. If she were to decide that she does not want to be with me anymore, I could be kicked to the curb and have no legal recourse to get my investment back. I am not saying she would not make an effort to pay me back but I know she does not have the funds to do so. 

I have recently said that I am not comfortable investing anymore money into the house until I legally own it. She will not put me on the deed. She wants me on the mortgage to be put on the deed although it does not make sense to refinance now or for the foreseeable future as the interest rate would be much higher than what we are locked in at. At this point I feel like this is boarder line financial abuse and I do not feel good about the situation. She says when the interest rates go down we can refinance and add me to the mortgage but I do not see that happening anytime soon and it is not a concrete. We are even on everything financially speaking and I think it would be fair to put me on the deed. :(

Here's why:

Both parties made poor decisions and are now handling the situation poorly:

1. The girlfriend sucks because:
- She's accepting significant financial contributions towards a property while refusing to protect her partner's investment
- She's insisting on expensive improvements (like the oven) while maintaining sole ownership
- She's setting unrealistic conditions (waiting for interest rates to drop) for adding him to the deed

2. The boyfriend sucks because:
- He agreed to invest significant money into a property without any legal protection
- He continued to pour money into improvements without getting anything in writing
- He waited until $30k deep to address this serious issue

The correct approach would have been to either:
- Create a legal agreement before any money changed hands
- Keep their finances separate until marriage
- Or have one person be the sole owner and the other pay fair market rent

Moving forward, they need to:
1. Stop any further investments in the property
2. Consult a lawyer to draft a contract protecting his investments
3. Consider couples counseling to address the trust issues this has created

This situation demonstrates why mixing significant finances before marriage without proper legal protection is risky for all parties involved.
